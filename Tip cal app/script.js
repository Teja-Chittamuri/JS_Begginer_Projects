/* 
ðŸŒŸ APP: Tip Calculator

These are the 3 functions you must use ðŸ‘‡
=========================================
calculateBill()
increasePeople()
decreasePeople()

These functions are hard coded in the HTML. So, you can't change their names.

These are all the DIV ID's you're gonna need access to ðŸ‘‡
========================================================
#1 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'billTotalInput' = User input for bill total
#2 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'tipInput' = User input for tip
#3 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'numberOfPeople' = Current number of people you're splitting the bill between
#4 ID ðŸ‘‰ 'perPersonTotal' = Total dollar value owed per person
*/

//  =============================================================================================

// Get global access to all inputs / divs here (you'll need them later ðŸ˜˜)
// bill input, tip input, number of people div, and per person total div

  // get the total tip amount
  const totalTip = bill * tip;
  // calculate the total (tip amount + bill)
  const totalBill = bill + totalTip;
  // calculate the per person total (total divided by number of people)
  let perPersonTotal = totalBill / numberOfPeople;
  // update the perPersonTotal on DOM & show it to user
  costPerPerson.innerText = `$${perPersonTotal.toFixed(2)}`; // \to fixed is for decimal points

// ** Splits the bill between more people **

  // increment the amount of people
  const incOfPeople = (numberOfPeople += 1);
  // update the DOM with the new number of people
